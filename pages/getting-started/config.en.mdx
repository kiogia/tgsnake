import {TabGroup,TabContent} from "@/components/Tab"

This is a config file for tgsnake. You can pass all option in there to make your index file is clean. 

## Option 
We have a many option then if you use them together it will make your index file long. The options are:
| name | type | description | 
| :---: | :----: |:----------: | 
| logger | string | Set Logger level for gramjs. Default is "none". | 
| apiHash | string | An api_hash got from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org) | 
| apiId | number | An api_id got from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org)
| session | string | String sessions | 
| botToken | string | Bot Token from botFather. If you need to login as bot this required | 
| tgSnakeLog | boolean | If set, tgsnake will showing the message in console like welcome to tgsnake or anything |  
| sessionName | string | To save the string session. | 
| storeSession | boolean | Using store session | 
| connection | any | The connection instance to be used when creating a new connection to the servers. It must be a type. Defaults to  ConnectionTCPFull on Node and ConnectionTCPObfuscated on browsers. | 
| useIPV6 | boolean | Whether to connect to the servers through IPv6 or not. By default this is false. | 
| timeout | number | The timeout in seconds to be used when connecting. This does nothing for now. | 
| requestRetries | number | How many times a request should be retried. Request are retried when Telegram is having internal issues (due to INTERNAL error or RPC_CALL_FAIL error), when there is a errors.FloodWaitError less than floodSleepThreshold, or when there's a migrate error. defaults to 5. | 
| connectionRetries | number | How many times the reconnection should retry, either on the initial connection or when Telegram disconnects us. May be set to a negative or undefined value for infinite retries, but this is not recommended, since the program can get stuck in an infinite loop. defaults to 5 | 
| proxy | ProxyInterface | Experimental proxy to be used for the connection. (only supports MTProxies) | 
| downloadRetries | number | How many times we should retry borrowing a sender from another DC when it fails. defaults to 5 |  
| retryDelay | number | The delay in milliseconds to sleep between automatic reconnections. defaults to 1000 | 
| autoReconnect | boolean | Whether reconnection should be retried connection_retries times automatically if Telegram disconnects us or not. defaults to true | 
| sequentialUpdates | boolean | does nothing for now | 
| floodSleepThreshold | number | The threshold below which the library should automatically sleep on flood wait and slow mode wait errors (inclusive). For instance, if a FloodWaitError for 17s occurs and floodSleepThreshold is 20s, the library will sleep automatically. If the error was for 21s, it would raise FloodWaitError instead. defaults to 60 sec. | 
| deviceModel | string | Device model to be sent when creating the initial connection. Defaults to os.type().toString(). | 
| systemVersion | string | System version to be sent when creating the initial connection. defaults to os.release().toString() -. | 
| appVersion | string | App version to be sent when creating the initial connection. Defaults to 1.0. | 
| langCode | string | Language code to be sent when creating the initial connection. Defaults to 'en'. |

| baseLogger | string | Does nothing for now. don't change. | 
| useWSS | boolean | Whether to try to connect over Wss (or 443 port) or not. |   

## Example Using 
First you must to create a `tgsnake.config.js` in root directory (where package.json is available).   
Then copy this code 
```js
// tgsnake.config.js
module.exports = {
    apiHash : "your api hash" 
    // fill with available options in here.
}
```

Then the index file should be :  
<TabGroup>
    <TabContent name="javascript">
    ```ts headlight=2 
    // index.js
    const {Snake} = require("snake")
    const bot = new Snake() // don't pass the option in here because you already pass in config file.
    // ...your code...
    bot.run()
    ```
    </TabContent>
    <TabContent name="typescript">
    ```ts headlight=2 
    // index.ts
    import {Snake} from "snake" 
    const bot = new Snake() // don't pass the option in here because you already pass in config file.
    // ...your code...
    bot.run()
    ```
    </TabContent>
</TabGroup> 

Done.
