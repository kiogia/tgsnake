In previous post we announce to release the v3 version of tgsnake with code name is `wayang kulit`. Now in this post, we will announce the breaking change before you upgrade from v2 to v3.

> v2 is not updated since v3 release, so let's migrate to v3

## Breaking your v2 code

Because v3 has 100% recode from v2, so it has major difference code style from v2. For example, some event handlers in v2 are updated like this:

```js
Message {
  chat : {}
  from : {}
  text : ''
}
```

now it will be look like bot api:

```js
Update {
  message : {
    chat: {}
    from: {}
    text: ''
  }
}
```

so, it totally broken your v2 code and you must be recode again.

### Different results

Yes, again regarding the JSON changes being returned. These changes to the JSON returned as results will break your code in v3. We are trying to make JSON follow bot api style so that it is easy to understand and can be used as a reference for other developers.

### Missing function

Because this is still in development (alpha) so many functions are not available yet, but you can invoke the Raw Api.

### Different config file

We completely overhauled the config file. We found the v2 config file to be inefficient and confusing, that's why we made a complete overhaul. But don't worry, session strings in v2 can still be used in v3. But not for the session file. **Please convert to string session first before migrating!**

## How to migrate?

Migration is quite simple, just install tgsnake v3 via npm or yarn.

```bash
yarn add tgsnake@alpha
```

v3 version now when this post was released, it was still in alpha version.
